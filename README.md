# CSGO Commend Bot
If you're a developer and want to know how to fix your own commend bot its very simple. Just set `steam_id_gs` to a valid server steam ID, on your target's account & bot accounts.

---

# Restrictions and Issues
There also is a limit of the amount of commends you can send within a specific amount of time, that limit is set to 20. Due to this I recommend leaving `perChunk` and `betweenChunks` default but you can always experiment around.

# Future
- Add the ability to remove commends
- Add the ability to commend three times with one account per 24 hours instead of once every 8 hours

# Requirements
- [NodeJS **v11 or later**](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Little bit of JSON knowledge](https://www.json.org/)

# Installation
1. Download this repository
2. Open a command prompt *inside* the folder
3. Enter `npm install`
4. Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and adjust it ([See below](#config))
5. Add accounts using the [Database Manager](#database-manager)
6. Run `node index.js`

Simple run it via `node databaseManager.js`, use the arrow keys & enter to navigate. Read on-screen instructions for more details.

# Botting Method
You can choose between two botting methods, `LOGIN` and `SERVER`.

- `LOGIN` will log into the targets account and automatically grab a server. `account` object **must** be filled with account details. Will ignore `target` & `serverID`.
- `SERVER` will assume the target is on the defined server - [Read More](#server-id)

# Server ID
The `serverID` field allows for either ServerIP, ServerID or `auto`.

- Server IP is self explanatory.
- ServerID can be found by entering `status` into the console ingame.
- - On a community server it will look like this: `1.37.0.1/13701 934/7508 secure  [A:1:1297634312:12708]` > `[A:1:1297634312:12708]`.
- - On a Valve server it will look like this: `Connected to =[A:1:3849827331:12657]:0` > `[A:1:3849827331:12657]`.
- - *Make sure to **only** include the stuff between the brackets and the brackets themselves.*
- `auto` will automatically try and find the correct server the target is on. This works for **all** official Valve servers and on community servers **if** the target has `cl_join_advertise` set to `2`.
